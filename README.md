# About the App
This app is providing live data about particles contamination in the air: PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, SO2. If there is N/D result in some stations it means that station is not measuring this data or it is not available at the moment. The percentage value is calculated according to WHO norms. If value is higher than 100% it means that contamination of the particle is exceeding the norm. Value smaller than 100% means contamination is lower than norm.
